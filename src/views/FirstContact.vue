        First Contact with Spanish

      <small>
        At Native Language College we want our students to be able to study at
        all levels including students that have never studied Spanish before,
        which is why we have created a First Contact course. It is a beginners
        level course which gives the students a strong, basic foundation of the
        Spanish language.

          <p>
            This course is designed for absolute beginners who have not had any
            type of contact with Spanish in the past. It is intended for those who
            want to obtain a basic understanding to be able to use it in their daily
            life, or for those who have the goal to study Spanish but their lack of
            knowledge prevents them from joining an A1 level class when it is
            already underway.
