            What is SIELE?
          </h3>

          <p>
            SIELE is an abbreviation for Servicio Internacional de Evaluación de la Lengua
            Española which certifies the proficiency of the Spanish language for students
            and professionals.
          </p>
          <p>
            SIELE was created and developed by the Instituto Cervantes of Madrid, the
            Universidad Autónoma de México, the Universidad de Salamanca and the
            Universidad de Buenos Aires. These institutions have guaranteed the quality
            standards in the creations of the exams, as well as the diversity of linguistic
            varieties in the Spanish speaking world.

            SIELE measures the degree of proficiency through a four-part test:
            reading comprehension, listening comprehension, written
            expression and interaction, and spoken expression and interaction.
            The exam measures language proficiency using the levels
            established by the Common European Framework of reference for
            Languages (CEFR).

            Much like the world famous TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign
            Language) candidates receive a score between 0 and 1,000 points,
            and unlike DELE (Spanish as a foreign language diploma), the SIELE
            exam is not a pass/fail exam. Candidates’ language proficiency will
            be assessed based on their overall score and will receive a
            certificate for the corresponding level of language (A1-C2).

            <p>
              This course is designed for students and professionals who are looking for a
              certification of their level of Spanish. The DELE or Diploma de Español como
              Lengua Extranjera (Diploma of Spanish as a Foreign Language) is an official
              qualification that accredits the degree of competence and mastery of the
              Spanish language granted by the Instituto Cervantes on behalf of the Ministry of
              Education, Culture and Sport. It is very useful not only to be able to demonstrate
              your level of Spanish wherever you are, but in most universities and in many jobs
              they require you to have this degree in order to be able to study or work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our classes are available for students with levels from A1 (equivalent to a
              beginner level) to C1 (equivalent to an advanced level).
            </p>
            <p>
              You can combine the DELE certification preparation course with a general
              Spanish course to achieve complete linguistic immersion, learning about the
              language and culture and preparing at the same time for the exam.

              Groups are small and a minimum of 2 students is required to form
              one. Due to this type of groups, the timetable will be adapted to the
              needs of the students, depending on the students of that level in each
              specific course. You should therefore ask first to make sure of the
              timetable of the courses being offered. Prior to registration, ask for a
              personal interview to assess your level and advise you on what type of
              course is best for you. This procedure allows us to get to know you
              and design the DELE preparation course focused on your needs.

            In this course, you will learn about all the necessary components of
            the exam needed to succeed. These important components include
            the types of task to be carried out, frequent topics, the structure of
            the exam, the time limits, and the criteria for the evaluation of the
            exam. You will be able to work with various exam exercises to
            develop all the linguistic skills so that you will be able to stay
            organized during the exam and manage time. This course will also
            enable you to consolidate and revise the knowledge that is
            necessary to pass the exam of the level you want. You will also be
            able to take at least one mock exam in real conditions to practice
            before the day of the test.
