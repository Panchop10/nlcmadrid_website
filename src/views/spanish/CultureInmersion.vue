            Conversation Class
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our special conversation class is all about speaking and is available at all
            levels. It is a chance for the students to practice their Spanish in a safe
            environment with the help of a teacher. It is dedicated to helping students
            gain the confidence to speak Spanish outside the school. A variety of
            relevant topics will be discussed in each class, for example how to apply for
            a job, how to express opinions, etc.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Every Friday, learn about important aspects of the Spanish language that
            will help you sound like a native speaker such as local expressions, phrases
            and words. With these activities you will have the opportunity to improve
            your level of interaction, learn even more vocabulary and feel like a part of
            the Spanish community.

              Day Excursions
            </h3>
            <p>
              One day a month the classes take place outside of the classroom so
              that the students can immerse themselves in the Spanish culture
              and explore Madrid with the teachers and fellow classmates. The
              students will attend current exhibitions in Madrid’s amazing
              museums such as the Prado and Reina Sofia. On other days they
              will go to other attractions such as Templo de Debod and in good
              weather the classes will take place in a park or café.
            </p>
            <p>
              All the excursions are within walking distance of the school, thanks
              to our central location right in Sol.
